# React + IMask

Simple project to show how to use IMask in ReactJS with regex.<br>
The MasterCard regex was used as an example - If the number entered in the input is from MasterCard, the border of the input turns green, otherwise it turns red.<br>
MasterCard numbers example: `5349 0234 9207 3492`, `2329 7329 4792 3759`.
